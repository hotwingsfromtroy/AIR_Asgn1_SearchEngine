# AIR_Asgn1_SearchEngine

Three implementations of btree made.

Version I - user defined classes for everything and pickling for local storage. Size of test file - 7KB

Version II - only a single user defined class, and pickling for local storage. Size of test file - 5KB

Version III - nested dictionaries, with json as the local storage. Size of test file - 8KB

Serialization better than json. User readability isn't a concern here. We can go with nested dictionaries with pickling. Maybe another method of serialization if it turns out to be better.
Check avro and protobuff for this.
